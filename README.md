Linear Regression to Predict MPG

LINEAR REGRESSION TO PREDICT MPG

There are not any variables/coefficients providing a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. Each dependent value is determined by random chance and error. Therefore, the linear model is a flat line and the slope is not zero. 

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 Ã— 10^-11 or in scientific e notation, 5.35e-11, which is the total amount of 0.0000000000535. The total amount of 0.0000000000535 is much smaller than our assumed signigicance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient 
evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

This linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. According to the linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, this is roughly 71% of all mpg time predictions to be considered as correct when using the linear model. On average, 71% out of 100% is not an accurate amount for the linear model to predict the mpg of MechaCar
prototypes effectively.
