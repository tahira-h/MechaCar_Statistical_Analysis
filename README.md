LINEAR REGRESSION TO PREDICT MPG

The variables/coefficients vehicle_length and ground_clearance provides a non-random variance to the mpg values in the dataset. These coefficients has a positive impact on the mpg on the MechaCar prototype, in contrast to the coefficients vehicle_weight, AWD, and spoiler_angle that provides a random variance and error to the mpg. Therefore, the linear model's slope is not zero. 

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 2.767 Ã— 10^-06 or in scientific e notation, 2.767e-06, which is the total amount of 0.000002767. The total amount of 0.000002767 is much smaller than our assumed signigicance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. According to the linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.7085, this is roughly 70.85% of all mpg time predictions to be considered as correct when using the linear model. On average, 70.85% out of 100% is an accurate amount for the linear model to predict the mpg of MechaCar
prototypes effectively.
